        <p><span class="body">While taking User Interface and User Experience course at Brown University, I, as a group, redesigned an app called <em>Fabric</em>. <em>Fabric</em> is a personal location-based archival journal that catalogs users’ experiences and interactions. We were attracted to the personal auto-memory tracking idea of the app, so we decided to keep the core idea while redesigning the whole workflow and aesthetic of this app.</span></p>

              We were mainly concerned about the confusing workflow of the app. They contain too many unnecessary features that lose the main point of the app. Also, their lack of back button makes the user to struggle to navigate smoothly through the app. </span></p>

              We also cared for the whole aesthetics of the app. Due to its excessive use of color and inconsistent design, we changed the color palette, font, and even created our own set of iconography in order to make the app look more professional and solid.</span></p>

              <p><span class="body"><strong>SKETCHES & SITEMAP</strong></br>Our redesigned interface is much simpler and smoother in navigation. We first redesigned the “import photos” function from scratch and focused on reducing the repeating screens because they had way too much ways to go back to one screen. Also, we even combined few screens that we thought it didn’t need a page.</span></p>

              After making a prototype, we did few different user tests. Firstly, we shared our Quant-UX link with the classmates and got comments from them, and we examined the heat map of each screen which was based on clicks. Then, we also conducted eye-tracking test to different users. Lastly, utilizing <em>usertesting.com</em>, we gave missions to people and asked specific questions at the end.
