        <p><span class="body">Shed is a campaign for promoting responsible animal ownership, specifically on dogs. Recently, I’ve seen so many videos about puppy mills and was so shocked to see how cruel the owners were. I’ve been thinking about how to stop puppy mills, started researching about them and finally realized that people need to be more informed and exposed to this. Many people already know about this problem; however, it is still an ongoing issue because people want “cute puppies.” They are more likely go to puppy mills, which is hidden by the name of pet stores, right away when they want a dog because people easily can “buy” specific breed of good-looking puppies. The real problem is that even after people adopt dog or dogs that they want, there are so many people who abandon their dogs just because their dogs get old and sick. Dogs are man’s best friends. They are not just a thing. Through Shed campaign, my goal is to tell people that dogs also can think and feel— to raise awareness to help people become more responsible owners.</span></p>

        I call this campaign, Shed, because the word ‘shed’ has multiple meanings, such as dogs’ losing their hair, casting light, and a shelter for animals. I try to make my identity system not too cute, but not too gloomy just because of the topic. Also, my engagement project ideas are focused on exposing animal shelters to people in order to prevent puppy mills and show how lovely dogs are despite of their appearance.</span></p>
