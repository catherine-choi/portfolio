        <p><span class="body">For this project, I was supposed to use both processing and webcam. When I thought about webcam, the word memory first came to my mind because I mostly used webcam to take fun photos with my friends and Skype with my family in Korea. Therefore, I decided to make this project playful and interactive. Inspired from Text Rain by Camille Utterback, I edited the original code by Marlena Abraham to make this short, simple game. Then, I asked my friends to play this game, but that’s not the end of this project. I documented the whole process of their playing the game. Now let’s see how they played the game!</span>

BUT that’s too easy. Since it’s a memory project, I gave each group a simple mission to complete the game.</span></p>
