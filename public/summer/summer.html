        <p><span class="body">Do you want to know how cool kids spend their summer in NY? Then, try using the app Summer In NY! This app is based on the article, <em>My Summer Survival Problem and Yours,</em> written by Jane Oâ€™Reilly. I was asked to design a new way for the reader of tomorrow to access and read it. The article tries to inform and encourages readers to use what kinds of free activities are out there in NY. When I first read the article, the problem was that the order of the content was very confusing even though the content itself was very useful. So I dissected the parts and organized them by categories, such as activities for men, women, and young children. Then, I found out that those activities were still available nowadays and decided to design an app for young children and their parents.</span></p>

        <p><span class="body">My focus was to convey the core message of the author, which was to encourage people to be more active. Therefore, I designed an app that has multiple games related to activities for children to play in order to intrigue their interest. Parents can, later, check what their children liked and get information about those activities. For the design of the app, I tried to make it look easy and friendly for children by using icons and unique colors!</span></p>
