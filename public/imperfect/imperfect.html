        <p><span class="body">I rebranded a campaign about body confidence, called "Be Real,” and renamed it to be called “I'mperfect," which conveys a message that imperfection is perfection. Through my campaign, I wanted to tell people that we all are equally important no matter how we look. Everybody is different; therefore, every body is unique! Throughout the identity system, I treated the apostrophe in the logotype as one individual person, and personified it. Any typeface could be used for the apostrophe according to different usage.</span></p>
