        <p><span class="body">My project is to design a type specimen of any modern typeface, and I’ve chosen Julien designed by Peter Biľak. He is a Slovakian graphic and typeface designer who have designed numerous distinct typefaces. I really like the playfulness of Julien and its geometric shapes. Also, it has my favorite, unique feature, called pseudo-randomization. This feature, giving the typeface a unique flow, has specific rules of repeated letters, and people can experiment with the fonts. Or they can overwrite the rules by choosing and inserting letters directly from the Glyph palette, which contains more than 1000 glyphs per style, and make the typeface more customizable and controllable.

            For my type specimen, I have made a series of small posters that could be hung on the wall while each poster contains different information about Julien. Then, I've folded the posters in half and put them in a folder.

            I’ve also designed a large-scale poster of Julien and tried to show variety of the typeface by overlapping the letters in different styles.
