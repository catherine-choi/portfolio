        <p><span class="body">I designed the identity system for one of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Chan Chan Archaeological Zone. Chan Chan, which was the largest city of the pre-Columbian era in South America, is now an archaeological site. I tried to convey tranquility of the site to give more elegant and formal look to the system. At the same time, the imageries from the site’s walls and sculptures were used as decorative elements. For the mark, I was inspired from the imagery of main walls, which represents fishnet, and used the negative space to get the shape. I drew nine of those because Chan Chan was divided by nine major citadels. Lastly, I used a limited color palettes which was beige and light blue in order to reflect the beauty and calmness of the site and the significance of the water and the sea in Chimú culture.</span></p>
